                <p>Main purpose of education is to educate individuals within society, to prepare and qualify them for
                    work in economy as well as to integrate people into society and teach them values and morals of

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed
                    necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                    imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                    cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                    imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                    Kingdom.[2]
                    Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in
                    1607
                    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city
                    of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual
                    cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE.
                    European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome
                    in CE 476.

                <h2>Development goals</h2>
                <p>Joseph Chimombo pointed out education's role as a policy instrument, capable of instilling social
                    change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving communities the opportunity to
                    take control of their destinies.[45] The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the
                    United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the
                    environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17
                    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.

                    Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased.
                    Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the
                    majority of children in most regions of the world attended school.</p>

                <h2>Technology in developing countries</h2>
                <p>Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living
                    in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement is still
                    causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries. Charities
                    like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged
                    may access educational materials.

                    The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a
                    stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely
                    available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations. </p>
